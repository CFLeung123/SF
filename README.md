standard perturbation theory: find renormalisation conditions

charm quark mass
gradient flow
combine with SF/chiSF?
small cutoff effects
small anomalous dim
improve statistical
independent analysis for 

determine O(a) improvement for stabilised fermion action 

different gauge action
different fermion action

SF+fermionic flow + gradient flow

in order to get improvement any of these can be useful





Zp from SF is too small too sensitive
